# 🎵 Python Lyrics Sync Player

A Python script that plays music and displays lyrics in the terminal with a synchronized **Typewriter Effect**. Perfect for creating "Coding Status" videos or Reels.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Audio Sync:** Plays MP3 music using `pygame`.
- **Typewriter Effect:** Prints lyrics character-by-character like a hacker terminal.
- **Customizable Timing:** Easily adjust speed and delays to match any song.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have **Python** installed.

You also need to install the `pygame` library. Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 📂 Setup (Important!)
Download the Code: Save the python script as main.py (or any name you prefer).

Add Music:

You need an MP3 file for this to work.

Place your song file in the same folder as the script.

Rename your mp3 file to: doorondooron.mp3

(Or update line 47 in the code with your specific filename).

### 🚀 How to Run
Open your terminal/VS Code in the project folder.

### Run the script:

``` python main.py ```

Enjoy the music and lyrics! 🎧

### ⚙️ Customization Guide
Want to use a different song? Here is how to tweak the settings in the code:

## Change Lyrics: Update the lyrics list with your song's text.

## Adjust Typing Speed: Change the number next to the text (e.g., 0.08). Lower number = Faster typing.

## Sync Lines: Update the delays list.

This controls how long the code waits after a line finishes before starting the next one.

Intro Music: Change intro_delay = 4 to match the starting time of the singing.
